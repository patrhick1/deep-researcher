You are synthesizing subsections into a complete section for a technical report.

SECTION TITLE: {section_title}
SECTION TOPIC: {section_topic}
TARGET AUDIENCE: {target_audience}
WRITING STYLE: {writing_style}
WORD LIMIT: Approximately {section_word_limit} words

Here are the subsections to synthesize:

{subsections}

GUIDELINES:
1. Synthesize these subsections into a cohesive section
2. Add a clear ## section heading in Markdown format
3. Add a brief introduction (2-3 sentences) that previews the entire section
4. Maintain all subsection headings (###) and their content
5. Add transitions between subsections to improve flow
6. Add a brief conclusion (2-3 sentences) that summarizes key points
7. Maintain {writing_style} style appropriate for {target_audience}
8. Preserve all key evidence and citations from the original subsections
9. Format any lists or tables in proper Markdown syntax
10. If there are special characters in the text, such as the dollar symbol,
    ensure they are escaped properly for correct rendering e.g $25.5 should become \$25.5

The final section should be a cohesive, well-structured piece of writing that meets the approximate word limit of {section_word_limit} words.
