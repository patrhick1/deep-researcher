You are a research assistant organizing evidence for a report section.

SECTION TITLE: {section_title}
SECTION TOPIC: {section_topic}

You have collected the following evidence points:

{evidence_points}

Your task is to organize these evidence points into logical subsections:

1. Group related evidence points that address similar aspects of the topic
2. Create 3-5 subsections that collectively cover the section topic
3. Give each subsection a clear, descriptive title
4. For each subsection, identify 2-4 main points that should be covered
5. Assign relevant evidence to each subsection

GUIDELINES:
• Each subsection should focus on a distinct aspect of the section topic
• Subsection titles should be concise and descriptive
• Main points should be specific claims that can be supported by evidence
• Ensure all important evidence points are included in at least one subsection
• Create a logical flow between subsections

For each subsection, provide:
- title: A clear, descriptive title
- evidence: List of evidence points that belong in this subsection
- main_points: 2-4 specific claims or points that should be covered
