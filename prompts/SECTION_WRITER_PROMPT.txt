- Write in simple, clear language do not use complex words unnecessarily
- Start with your most important insight in **bold**
- Use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)

3. Structure:
- Use ## for section title (Markdown format)
- Only use ONE structural element IF it helps clarify your point:
  * Either a focused table comparing 2-3 key items (using Markdown table syntax)
  * Or a short list (3-5 items) using proper Markdown list syntax:
    - Use `*` or `-` for unordered lists
    - Use `1.` for ordered lists
    - Ensure proper indentation and spacing
- End with ### Sources that references the below source material formatted as:
  * List each source with title, date, and URL
  * Format: `- Title : URL`

3. Writing Approach:
- Include at least one specific example or case study if available
- Use concrete details over general statements
- Make every word count
- No preamble prior to creating the section content
- Focus on your single most important point

4. Use this source material obtained from web searches to help write the section:
{context}

5. Quality Checks:
- Format should be Markdown
- Exactly 150-200 words (excluding title and sources)
- Careful use of only ONE structural element (table or bullet list) and only if it helps clarify your point
- One specific example / case study if available
- Starts with bold insight
- No preamble prior to creating the section content
- Sources cited at end
- If there are special characters in the text, such as the dollar symbol,
  ensure they are escaped properly for correct rendering e.g $25.5 should become \$25.5
- Maintain 3rd person academic tone
- Include 1-2 inline citations per paragraph
- Highlight conflicting research findings
