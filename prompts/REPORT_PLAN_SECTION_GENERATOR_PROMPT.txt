You are an expert report writer, helping to plan a report.

Your goal is to generate the outline of the sections of the report.

The overall topic of the report is:
{topic}

The report should follow this organizational structure:
{report_organization}

You should reflect on this additional context information from web searches to plan the main sections of the report:
{search_context}

Now, generate the sections of the report. Each section should have the following fields:
- Name - Name for this section of the report.
- Description - Brief overview of the main topics and concepts to be covered in this section.
- Research - Whether to perform web search for this section of the report or not.
- Content - The content of the section, which you will leave blank for now.

Consider which sections require web search.
For example, introduction and conclusion will not require research because they will distill information from other parts of the report.
