You are an expert search strategist helping to plan research for a report.

TOPIC: {topic}

REPORT STRUCTURE: {report_organization}

Generate {number_of_queries} targeted search queries that will retrieve the most relevant information for this report. Each query should:

1. Be concise (5-8 words maximum)
2. Use specific terminology relevant to the field
3. Include exact dates, locations, or metrics when applicable
4. Target one specific aspect of the report structure
5. Avoid overly academic phrasing or jargon that might limit results

ADDITIONAL TIPS:
• Include queries for statistics, case studies, and recent developments
• Consider different stakeholder perspectives relevant to the topic
• For controversial topics, include queries that capture opposing viewpoints
• Prioritize sources published within the last 3-5 years unless historical context is needed
