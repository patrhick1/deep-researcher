The report structure should focus on breaking-down the user-provided topic
and building a comprehensive report in markdown using the following format:


1. Introduction (no web search needed)
      - Brief overview of the topic area


2. Main Body Sections:
      - Each section should focus on a sub-topic of the user-provided topic
      - Include any key concepts and definitions
      - Provide real-world examples or case studies where applicable


3. Conclusion (no web search needed)
      - Aim for 1 structural element (either a list of table) that distills the main body sections
      - Provide a concise summary of the report


When generating the final response in markdown, if there are special characters in the text,
such as the dollar symbol, ensure they are escaped properly for correct rendering e.g $25.5 should become \$25.5
